== General Usage

It's most convenient when creating an application to also create the database at the same time. When creating a "greenfield" application like this you can let Hibernate create your tables for you (e.g. using a `dbCreate` value of `create-drop` or `update`). But often the database already exists, and creating GORM domain classes from them can be a tedious process.

This plugin will save you a lot of time by using the JDBC metadata API to inspect your database schema and create domain classes for you, using some assumptions and augmented by configuration options that you set.

The core of the plugin is the <<db-reverse-engineer>> command. There are too many configuration options to support specifying them when running the command, so it takes no arguments and uses configuration options set in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy`. These are described in the <<configuration>> section.

Note that running the command like a typical Grails command (i.e. `grails db-reverse-engineer`) will fail due to a bug when parsing the `grails.factories` file in the plugin jar's `META-INF` folder. This is not a problem however since the simple workaround is to run it as a Gradle task:

....
$ ./gradlew dbReverseEngineer
....

=== Environments

You can choose which database to read from by specifying the environment when running the command. For example to use the development environment settings, just run

....
$ ./gradlew dbReverseEngineer
....

To use the production environment settings, run

....
$ ./gradlew -Dgrails.env=prod dbReverseEngineer
....

And if you want to use a custom 'staging' environment configured in `DataSource.groovy`, run

....
$ ./gradlew -Dgrails.env=staging dbReverseEngineer
....

=== Re-running the reverse engineering script

If you have new or changed tables you can re-run the <<db-reverse-engineer>> command to pick up changes and additions. This is not an incremental process though, so existing classes will be overwritten and you will lose any changes you made since the last run. But it's simple to define which tables to include or exclude.

As described in <<configuration>> section, you can use a combination of the `grails.plugin.reveng.includeTables`, `grails.plugin.reveng.includeTableRegexes`, `grails.plugin.reveng.includeTableAntPatterns`, `grails.plugin.reveng.excludeTables`, `grails.plugin.reveng.excludeTableRegexes`, and `grails.plugin.reveng.excludeTableAntPatterns` properties to define which tables to include or exclude.

By default all tables are included, and the plugin assumes you're more likely to exclude than include. So you can specify one or more table names to explicitly exclude using `grails.plugin.reveng.excludeTables`, one or more regex patterns for exclusion using `grails.plugin.reveng.excludeTableRegexes`, and one or more Ant-style patterns for exclusion using `grails.plugin.reveng.excludeTableAntPatterns`.

For example, using this configuration

[source,java]
----
grails.plugin.reveng.excludeTables = ['clickstream', 'error_log']
grails.plugin.reveng.excludeTableRegexes = ['temp.+']
grails.plugin.reveng.excludeTableAntPatterns = ['audit_*']
----

you would process all tables except `clickstream` and `error_log`, and any tables that start with 'temp' (e.g. `tempPerson`, `tempOrganization`, etc.) and any tables that start with 'audit_' (e.g. 'audit_orders', 'audit_order_items', etc.)

If you only want to include one or a few tables, it's more convenient to specify inclusion rules rather than exclusion rules, so you use `grails.plugin.reveng.includeTables`, `grails.plugin.reveng.includeTableRegexes`, and `grails.plugin.reveng.includeTableAntPatterns` for that. If any of these properties are set, the table exclusion rules are ignored.

For example, using this configuration

[source,java]
----
grails.plugin.reveng.includeTables = ['person', 'organization']
----

you would process (or re-process) just the `person` and `organization` tables. You can also use The `grails.plugin.reveng.includeTableRegexes` and `grails.plugin.reveng.includeTableAntPatterns` properties to include tables based on patterns.

You can further customize the process by specifying which columns to exclude per-table. For example, this configuration

[source,java]
----
grails.plugin.reveng.excludeColumns = ['some_table': ['col1', 'col2'],
                                       'another_table': ['another_column']]
----

will exclude columns `col1` and `col2` from table `some_table`, and column `another_column` from table `another_table`.

You can also use the `grails.plugin.reveng.excludeColumnRegexes` and `grails.plugin.reveng.excludeColumnAntPatterns` properties to define patterns for columns to exclude.

=== Destination folder

By default the domain classes are generated under the `grails-app/domain` folder in the package specified. But you can override the destination, for example if you're re-running the process and want to compare the new classes with the previous ones.

By default the `db-reverse-engineer` script will overwrite existing classes. You can set the `grails.plugin.reveng.overwriteExisting` property to `false` to override this behavior and not overwrite existing files.

=== Many-to-many tables

Typically many-to-many relationships are implemented using a join table which contains just two columns which are foreign keys referring to the two related tables. It's possible for join tables to have extra columns though, and this will cause problems when trying to infer relationships. By default Hibernate will only consider tables that have two foreign key columns to be join tables. To get the script to correctly use join tables with extra columns, you can specify the table names with the `grails.plugin.reveng.manyToManyTables` property. This is demonstrated in the <<tutorial>>.

Another problem with many-to-many relationships is that one of the two GORM classes needs to be the 'owning' side and the other needs to be the 'owned' side, but this cannot be reliably inferred from the database. Both classes need a `hasMany` declaration, but the 'owned' domain class also needs a `belongsTo` declaration. So all of your many-to-many related tables need to have the tables that will create the `belongsTo` classes specified in the `grails.plugin.reveng.manyToManyBelongsTos` property. This is demonstrated in the <<tutorial>>.

=== Optimistic locking columns

Hibernate assumes that columns used for optimistic lock detection are called `version`. If you have customized one or more column names, you can direct the script about what the custom names are with the `grails.plugin.reveng.versionColumns` property. This is demonstrated in the <<tutorial>>.

=== Logging

All of the plugin classes are in the `grails.plugin.reveng` package, so you can configure that package for logging to see generated messages.
