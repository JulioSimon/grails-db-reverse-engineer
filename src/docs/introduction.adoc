== Introduction to the DB Reverse Engineering Plugin

The DB Reverse Engineering plugin reads database table information using JDBC and uses the schema data to create domain classes. This is a complex problem and the plugin is unlikely to get things 100% correct. But it should save you a lot of work and hopefully not require too much tweaking after the domain classes are generated.

The plugin uses the [Hibernate Tools|http://hibernate.org/tools/] library, with custom code to generate GORM domain classes instead of Java POJOs.

See the <<tutorial>> for information on how to install and configure the plugin.

Also refer to the <<configuration>> section for the various configuration options.
