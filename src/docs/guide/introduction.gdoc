The DB Reverse Engineering plugin reads database table information using JDBC and uses the schema data to create domain classes. This is a complex problem and the plugin is unlikely to get things 100% correct. But it should save you a lot of work and hopefully not require too much tweaking after the domain classes are generated.

The 3.x.x versions of the plugin work with Hibernate 3. If you're using Hibernate 4, use the latest version 4.x.x of the plugin.

The plugin uses the [Hibernate Tools|http://hibernate.org/tools/] library, with custom code to generate GORM domain classes instead of Java POJOs.
