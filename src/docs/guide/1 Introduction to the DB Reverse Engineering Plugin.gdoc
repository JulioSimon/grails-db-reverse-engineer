The DB Reverse Engineering plugin reads database table information using JDBC and uses the schema data to create domain classes. This is a complex problem and the plugin is unlikely to get things 100% correct. But it should save you a lot of work and hopefully not require too much tweaking after the domain classes are generated.

The plugin uses the [Hibernate Tools|http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/tools.html] library, with custom code to generate GORM domain classes instead of Java POJOs.

{note}
As of version 0.5, the plugin only works with Grails 2.0 and above. Use version 0.3 (not 0.4) for Grails 1.3.x.
